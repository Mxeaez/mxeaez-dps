# Progress log

Newest entry first. One entry per phase (or per notable fix). Keep entries short: what was done, how it was
verified, what's unverified / left for later.

## Phase 0 — Setup (2026-10-22)

- Cloned `weirdgloop/osrs-dps-calc` at `89c3e25` as a blobless clone (`--filter=blob:none`); remote renamed to `upstream`.
- `yarn install` (vendored Yarn 4.9.2, run as `node .yarn/releases/yarn-4.9.2.cjs`) OK on Node 24.19 (repo's `.nvmrc` says 18; no issues seen).
- Baseline `yarn test`: 27 suites / 333 tests pass, 4 skipped.
- `yarn dev` serves `http://localhost:3001/osrs-dps` (port 3000 is taken by something else on this machine).
- Added `@playwright/test` (1.64.1) + Chromium; smoke screenshot of the running app OK.
- Confirmed via the wiki Bucket API that all in-scope bosses have `infobox_monster` rows (see ROADMAP.md table), except Ocellus Phase 2 which lacks hp/id.
- Wrote ROADMAP.md, PROGRESS.md, CLAUDE.md.

Unverified / open: party-size HP formula; Ocellus P2 data; drain caps on Smorks/Bork/Dreadnoth.
